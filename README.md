# Automatic_Gas_Regulator
This project to prevent from Gas leakage accident ....


Problems & Solution:
A GAS LEAK REFERS TO A LEAK OF NATURAL GAS OR ANOTHER GASEOUS PRODUCT FROM A PIPELINE OR 
OTHER CONTAINMENT INTO ANY AREA WHERE THE GAS SHOULD NOT BE PRESENT. GAS LEAKS CAN BE 
HAZARDOUS TO HEALTH AS WELL AS THE ENVIRONMENT. EVEN A SMALL LEAK INTO A BUILDING OR OTHER 
CONFINED SPACE MAY GRADUALLY BUILD UP AN EXPLOSIVE OR LETHAL CONCENTRATION OF 
GAS. LEAKS OF NATURAL GAS AND REFRIGERANT GAS INTO THE ATMOSPHERE ARE ESPECIALLY 
HARMFUL DUE TO THEIR GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AND OZONE DEPLETION POTENTIAL.

LEAKS OF GASES ASSOCIATED WITH INDUSTRIAL OPERATIONS AND EQUIPMENT ARE ALSO GENERALLY 
KNOWN AS FUGITIVE EMISSIONS. NATURAL GAS LEAKS FROM FOSSIL FUEL EXTRACTION AND USE ARE 
KNOWN AS FUGITIVE GAS EMISSIONS. SUCH UNINTENDED LEAKS SHOULD NOT BE CONFUSED WITH SIMILAR 
INTENTIONAL TYPES OF GAS RELEASE, SUCH AS:
GAS VENTING EMISSIONS WHICH ARE CONTROLLED RELEASES, AND OFTEN PRACTICED AS A PART OF 
ROUTINE OPERATIONS, OR
"EMERGENCY PRESSURE RELEASES" WHICH ARE INTENDED TO PREVENT EQUIPMENT DAMAGE AND 
SAFEGUARD LIFE.
GAS LEAKS SHOULD ALSO NOT BE CONFUSED WITH "GAS SEEPAGE" FROM THE EARTH OR OCEANS - EITHER 
NATURAL OR DUE TO HUMAN ACTIVITY.
IN INDIA MORE THAN 632 GAS LEAKAGE ARE HAPPEN PER YEAR 
WHICH IS CAUSING HIGH LIFE RISK.


Approach :
1.WE WILL USE SENSORS, BUZZER AND MOTOR FOR AUTO SWITCH 
REGULATOR .
2.A BATTERY FOR POWER SUPPLY
3.SOME WIRES WILL WE THERE
4.AND SOME IOT DEVICES LIKE ARDUINO, MQ6 AND L293D IC.



Upcoming Problems 
1. BATTERY NEEDS TO BE CHARGED TIME TO TIME.
2. INSTALLATION SHOULD BE DONE BY TRAINED PERSON.
